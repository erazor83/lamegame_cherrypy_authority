OpenID
======

Being an openID server
======================
If python-openid is installed, then there is an OpenID endpoint set up automatically at (authroot)/openid.  If you would like your site root to be an open ID endpoint, put the following meta tag in the index page (e.g. http://www.lamegameproductions.com):

<meta http-equiv="x-xrds-location" content="https://www.lamegameproductions.com/auth/openid/xrds" />

Replace www.lamegameproductions.com/auth with your auth root.  It is probably wise to ensure that the xrds location is accessed through https.

Users may also use the /auth/openid URL as an endpoint, even if you don't put that meta tag on your root.
